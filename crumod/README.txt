Crustal models obtained for the article "Effects of chemical composition, water and temperature on physical properties of continental crust" by Guerri, Cammarano, Connolly, G-CUBED, 2015.

Fields are on a 180X360 Atlantic centered grid.

ctall: layers thicknesses (as in CRUST 1.0). 1) Water.
                                             2) Ice.
                                             3) Upper sediments.
                                             4) Middle sediments.
                                             5) Lower sediments.
                                             6) Upper crust.
                                             7) Middle crust.
                                             8) Lower crust.
rall: Densities.
rhom: Mantle density underneath the Moho (as in CRUST 1.0).
tempall: Temperatures.
Topography: Topography as in CRUST 1.0.
vpall: Vp velocities.
Vpm: Mantle Vp underneath the Moho (as in CRUST 1.0).
vsall: Vs velocities.
Vsm: Mantle Vs underneath the Moho (as in CRUST 1.0).

Check the paper for the meanings of the models names.
When "pf" is added it means that Vp and densities have been corrected for porosity. Pores filled with water.
